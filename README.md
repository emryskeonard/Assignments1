Differentiate between web1, web2 and web3
Sure, here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Web 1.0**: Often referred to as the "read-only" web, Web 1.0 was characterized by static web pages where users could only consume content. It was primarily a one-way communication platform, with limited interaction or user-generated content. Websites were basic and mainly consisted of text and images.

2. **Web 2.0**: Web 2.0 marked a shift towards a more interactive and participatory web experience. This era introduced dynamic web pages, social media platforms, user-generated content, and web applications. Users could now not only consume content but also create and share their own content through blogs, social networks, wikis, and other platforms.

3. **Web 3.0**: Web 3.0, often referred to as the "semantic web" or "decentralized web," represents the next evolution of the internet. It aims to make online data more interconnected, intelligent, and secure. Web 3.0 technologies include blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, decentralized applications (DApps), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This phase focuses on decentralization, interoperability, and data ownership, enabling more personalized and secure online experiences.
